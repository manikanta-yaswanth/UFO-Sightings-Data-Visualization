# UFO-Sightings-Data-Visualization
The skies above us hold more than just Sun, Moon, Stars and Satellites. The phenomenon of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) continues to intrigue and mystify. Reports of unexplained aerial sightings have been a part of human history for centuries, and they remain an area of public interest and scientific investigation. With countless sightings reported each year, the USA stands out as a hotspot for such unexplained events followed by Canada. I’ve used a couple of data sets from NUFORC database and one data set from OpenFlights. we turn a jumble of latitudes and longitude into a clear path. By utilizing data visualization techniques, we work some magic with data transformation, sorting and organizing information so it makes sense. Plus, we use R Scripts that's great for stats and graphs, to help us see the big picture by analysis to find patterns and occurrences of UFO sightings across the United States. By marrying the OpenFlights data with reported UFO sightings, we're charting a course to possibly explain the unexplained.
Research Questions:
1. What are the spatial patterns of UFO sightings across United States, Canada and are there any notable concentrations or dispersions of sightings in relation to geographical features or population centers?
2. What are the trends in UFO sighting reports in the United States, Canada and how do the frequencies of these reports vary on a yearly, monthly, and daily basis?
3. What are the distribution patterns of UFO sightings in terms of the reported shapes, and is there a predominance of specific shapes in the reported sightings across different regions of the United States?
4. How does the reported duration of UFO sightings vary across different incidents, and are there identifiable patterns in the lengths of these events that could provide insights into UFO activity?
5. How have patterns of UFO sightings evolved geographically and temporally over recent years, and is there evidence of concentrated activity in specific regions that correlates with changes over time?
6. What are the global patterns in the distribution of airports, and how do geographic factors influence the spread of airports around the world?
7. What is the frequency of UFO sighting reports within various distance ranges from the nearest airport, and do sightings tend to occur more often closer to or farther from these airport locations?
 8. Future Research Questions:
•	Are there discernible patterns in UFO sighting reports that align with commercial airplane travel routes, based on the starting and ending coordinates of flights, and what does this imply about the nature of these sightings?
•	How do weather conditions influence the frequency and geographical distribution of UFO sightings?
